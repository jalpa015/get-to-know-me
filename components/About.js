                            I am a researcher and a developer at the University of Windsor, ON, Canada. I am an experienced Software Developer. 
                            During my work experience, I have developed mobile applications and worked closely on developing customized CRM features using AngularJS, 
                            Spring MVC architecture and Java programming. I have worked with Cordova to build Android and iOS mobile applications. 
                            Over time, I have learned new technologies and frameworks like NextJS and TailWind.

                            During my Master&apos;s degree, I have picked up Machine Learning and AI skills. I got the opportunity to learn and implement Data Visulaziations 
                            and Modeling on varying datasets during my volunteer work experience at WinAIML. I also explored EDA and NLP techniques on Twitter and movie 
                            datasets, to list a few. I learned various frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras during the research and deployed an ML model on AWS Cloud 
                            instance and Google Cloud.
