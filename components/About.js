              I am a researcher and a developer at the University of Windsor,
              ON, Canada. I am an experienced Software Developer. During my work
              experience, I have developed mobile applications and worked
              closely on developing customized CRM features using AngularJS,
              Spring MVC architecture and Java programming. I have worked with
              Cordova to build Android and iOS mobile applications. Over time, I
              have learned new technologies and frameworks like NextJS and
              TailWind.

              During my Co-op experience, I have closely worked with Relational
              Database(MySQL). I have also had the opportunity to develop custom
              jQuery plugins for the inventory dashboard. The experience also
              gave me exposure to writing stored procedures and reports for
              Microsoft SQL Server.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              During my Master&apos;s degree, I have picked up Machine Learning
              and AI skills. I got the opportunity to learn and implement Data
              Visulaziations and Modeling on varying datasets during my
              volunteer work experience at WinAIML. I also explored EDA and NLP
              techniques on Twitter and movie datasets, to list a few. I learned
              various frameworks like Tensorflow and Keras during the research
              and deployed an ML model on AWS Cloud instance and Google Cloud.
